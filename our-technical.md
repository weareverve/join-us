# The Verve Developer Technical Challenge

## What's this?

There's only so much that anyone can put on a CV. Equally there's only so much that we can include in a role advert. More than anything, we're looking for problem solvers and those ready to roll their sleeves up and take on a challenge.

Our technical isn't a pass or fail test - there's no right answer. What we're interested in is seeing how you approach a problem with limited time. How do you prioritise? How do you build an MVP? What would you look at with more time? The 60 minute technical tells us all this and more.

## The Challenge

* Using PHP, interact with the open GitHub API to create a basic search tool with a front-end where the user can search for a GitHub account.
* The return data should include information on the user and also list their 5 most-starred repositories.
* The returned data should be presented in a way that is easy to read (i.e. a basic HTML front-end).
* This should be able run as a web application (i.e. could be uploaded to a server and accessible via a URL) - we don’t expect you to actually put this on a server, we’d just like to see the code.

You can use any frameworks, dependencies and packages that you would like to - we just ask that the core language used for interacting with the API is PHP.

If you have time, please also consider __any three__ of the following (implementation is entirely optional, but your comments or ideas on how you could implement this with more time are definitely appreciated).

* How would you handle rate limiting?
* How would you handle fundamental errors, such as an API being down?
* If building for scale, what would you implement to optimise performance for the end user?
* What tooling could you use to implement testing?
* If this tool was frequently updated by a team, how would you manage version control?
