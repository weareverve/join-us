# Hello. Hey. Hi.

Hey üëãüèº 

You probably know by now, but we're The Verve Group and if you've made it this far, we‚Äôre guessing that you want to find out about our technology teams and how you can get involved. Fortunately, you're in the right place!

Our priority is our people, and providing an environment where people can learn, grow and thrive whilst working together to change the face of finance. We understand that no two people are the same, so it makes sense that no two roles are identical. With that in mind, whilst we'll begin to share what we‚Äôre looking for, and what a role here at The Verve Group could look like for you, this is just the beginning, and we‚Äôre keen to work with you to shape your career.

## Useful Links

Throughout this doc, you'll find links to things like our application form and technical, but for convenience, we've listed them here too:

* [Technology Careers at Verve - Application Form](https://careers.weareverve.co.uk/departments/technology)
* [The Verve Technical Challenge](https://github.com/weareverve/join-us/blob/main/our-technical.md)

## The Stack

We work predominantly on the LAMP stack and have a range of technologies in our toolbox. Whilst we wouldn't expect you to be familiar with them all, here's an idea of what you'll be working with:

* PHP, using the likes of Laravel and Composer.
* MySQL.
* JavaScript, using frameworks like Vue.js.
* REST APIs.

At The Verve Group and as developers, we share a common goal of developing to make a difference, but each of us is different too. We have different strengths, aims and ideas. Here‚Äôs some of the additional skills and areas that you‚Äôll experience as part of the team (if you‚Äôve already got experience in some, great!);

* Project Management.
* Experience of MVC.
* Understanding of Test Driven Development (TDD).
* Ability to manage time and tasks.

## The Roles

We operate a fairly standard structure of career progression across technology roles. For developers, that looks like:

| Role | Starting Salary | Top of Bracket | Office Days (per week) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Junior Web Developer | ¬£21,000 | ¬£27,000 | 3* |
| Mid-level Web Developer | ¬£28,000 | ¬£36,000 | 2 |
| Senior Web Developer | ¬£37,000 | ¬£45,000 | 1 |

__All of our roles include office time and are therefore hybrid (not remote).__

_* Junior roles are subject to 6 months probation, where staff may be expected to work from the office more than three days per week._

## The Application Process

It all starts with an application. We're very protective of the culture we've created - it's something we're very proud of. Every single member of the team has a responsibility in making sure that 'work' continues to be a place we all enjoy and thrive in, and we hold three values dear as a company, (Got Your Back, World Class Quality, and Innovation). They've got us to where we are today and are the reason we follow a values-based recruitment process. So, the first thing we want to know is about you and your values, in the hope we‚Äôre a perfect match! [Our application form](https://careers.weareverve.co.uk/departments/technology) does just that.

### Initial Chat

With your application in our inbox, we‚Äôd love to have a chat. This could be in person at our Darlington HQ, via video call or by phone - whichever you're most comfortable with. This is an informal chat around your experience, your goals and what you're looking for as well as an opportunity to learn a little more about us, why we‚Äôre different, what we're doing and what you would be a key part of. We'll be happy to answer any questions you may have and we'd love to find out more about you - your experience, your aims and what really makes you tick.

### 60 Minute Technical Challenge

We don't like the word 'test' - it sounds very 'pass or fail'. In technology in particular, there are so many ways to achieve the same outcome for a task. What we're interested in is how you approach the task in the first place - your thought process and decision making. To begin to get an insight into this, we have a standard task that we ask anyone to take a look at and work on for 60 minutes, working with the public GitHub API. [You can even read the technical brief here](https://github.com/weareverve/join-us/blob/main/our-technical.md)- no surprises.

Take a look at the task and begin to approach it using any language or technology you're comfortable with. Then, in a `README.md` file, make a note of your process and, if given more time, what you would explore next.

We know it's not a lot of time! But it really helps show us how you'd explore an API, immediately tackle a task and begin to plan for future development.

### Final Interview

As a group, we're really informal and this is as formal as our process gets. This is a final opportunity for all of us to ask any questions and learn more about how we could work together on our mission.

All being well, we'd love to have you as a member of our team and it's at this stage that we'd look to make an offer.
